# The Bus to Lake O'hara
Get notified via text when a seat opens up on the bus to [Lake O'Hara, BC](https://www.hikebiketravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lake-OHara-087-copy.jpg). The bus to this beautiful place is notoriously full, and it happens quickly - if you're like me you will want to know if someone cancels immediately. This script will check for you at whatever frequency (be nice) you desire and sends you a text if it happens. You must be signed up on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for the latter. Free trial account should be all you need.   

### What You Need

* Some sort of javascript pre-processor. I used Babel for this, created on codepen.
* A link to one line of HTML: `<div id='app'></div>`
